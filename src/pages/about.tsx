      <hr />
      <p>
        I am a full stack developer with experience in Javascript Java, and
        Python, building with multiple frameworks such as with React, Gatsby,
        Vue and Typescript, and working with both relational and NoSQL databases
        such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
      </p>

      <p>
        I utilize the communication and mentor skills I gained previously in
        management to closely work with my team every day, both bettering myself
        and promoting my teammates&apos; success through learning with a focus
        on personal growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love to write easy-to-read code to elegantly solve problems, building
        with new frameworks and technologies, and I get excited at the prospect
        of sharing knowledge with others. I also enjoy attending social web
        developer meetups.
